# Dota 2 Coach MVP - Performance Metrics & Evaluation

## Overview

This experiment evaluates the performance of our Dota 2 coaching system using Game State Integration (GSI) data. The system provides real-time last-hit timing, positioning advice, and farming efficiency feedback using both rule-based heuristics and reinforcement learning policies.

## System Components

### 1. GSI Data Intake (`src/gsi/`)
- **HTTP Listener**: Receives real-time game state from Dota 2 client
- **Schema Parsing**: Structured parsing of hero, items, creeps, map state
- **JSON Persistence**: Rolling log files with timestamps for offline analysis

### 2. Coaching System (`src/coach/`)
- **Rule-Based Coach**: Simple heuristics for CS rate, deny rate, GPM benchmarks
- **RL Bridge**: Integration with trained last-hit policy for attack timing
- **Live Shell**: Real-time terminal output with optional TTS support

### 3. Offline Analysis (`scripts/replay_offline.py`)
- **Log Replay**: Process historical GSI data for analysis
- **Metrics Calculation**: CS@5min, CS@10min, deny rates, suggestion accuracy
- **Performance Comparison**: Baseline vs. coached performance

## Key Metrics

### Last-Hit Performance
- **CS@5min**: Creep score at 5 minutes (benchmark: 38 for core roles)
- **CS@10min**: Creep score at 10 minutes (benchmark: 80 for core roles)
- **CS per minute**: Overall farming efficiency throughout game
- **Deny Rate**: Denies / (CS + Denies) ratio (target: 10-20%)

### Gold Efficiency
- **GPM**: Gold per minute (benchmarks: 300+ poor, 400+ decent, 500+ excellent)
- **Gold Sources**: Breakdown of creep kills vs. other sources
- **Item Timing**: Key farming items acquired by target times

### Coaching Effectiveness
- **Suggestion Rate**: Suggestions per minute by type and priority
- **Prediction Accuracy**: RL policy confidence vs. actual last-hit success
- **Response Time**: Time from suggestion to player action
- **Improvement Rate**: Performance delta with vs. without coaching

## Experimental Setup

### Data Collection
```bash
# Start GSI data collection
python -m src.gsi.client --port 3000 --data-dir data/gsi_logs

# Dota 2 launch with GSI enabled
steam://rungameid/570//-gamestateintegration
```

### Baseline Measurement (No Coaching)
```bash
# Collect 5-10 games without coaching active
# Focus on solo queue ranked matches for consistency
# Record: CS@5, CS@10, GPM, deny rate, item timings
```

### Coached Performance
```bash
# Rule-based coaching
python -m src.coach.live_shell --coach rules --tts

# RL-based coaching (requires trained policy)
python -m src.coach.live_shell --coach rl --policy artifacts/rl_ckpts/best.pt --tts

# Combined coaching
python -m src.coach.live_shell --coach combined --policy artifacts/rl_ckpts/best.pt
```

### Offline Analysis
```bash
# Analyze replay logs
python scripts/replay_offline.py data/gsi_logs/gsi_log_20241201_120000.jsonl \
  --coach rules --verbose --output results/analysis_rules.json

python scripts/replay_offline.py data/gsi_logs/gsi_log_20241201_120000.jsonl \
  --coach rl --policy artifacts/rl_ckpts/best.pt \
  --verbose --output results/analysis_rl.json
```

## Expected Results

### Hypothesis
1. **Rule-based coaching** should improve CS consistency by 10-15% through awareness
2. **RL coaching** should improve last-hit timing accuracy by 5-10% over rules
3. **Combined approach** should achieve best overall performance
4. **Greatest improvement** expected for players in Herald-Crusader brackets
